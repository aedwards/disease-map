			<b>Countries and Agent labels:</b>
			  As you move your mouse over the map, country names will pop up. Place your cursor on one of the colored dots to see the associated 
			select agent name. Each dot signals that a disease outbreak caused by that agent was observed in that country during the 22-month period surveyed.
			It is not necessary to click on countries or dots to see pop-up labels. (<b>Note:</b> The placement of dots on the map <b>does</b> not correspond 
			to the location of an outbreakâ€”we have made no attempt to represent the specific location of disease outbreaks. Rather, the dots merely indicate 
			the presence of an outbreak caused by a specific pathogen in a given country.)
